(defn chime-ch
  "Returns a core.async channel that 'chimes' at every time in the
  times list. Times that have already passed are ignored.

  Arguments:
    times - (required) Sequence of java.util.Dates, org.joda.time.DateTimes
                       or msecs since epoch

    ch    - (optional) Channel to chime on - defaults to a new unbuffered channel
                       Closing this channel stops the schedule.

  Usage:

    (let [chimes (chime-ch [(-> 2 t/secs t/ago) ; has already passed, will be ignored.
                            (-> 2 t/secs t/from-now)
